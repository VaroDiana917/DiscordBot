<h4> Please note that the Bot Token used to run this bot is saved locally as to not make changes to the original bot, but you can create a Discord bot that reuses this code by
    <ul>
        <li>Going to the Discord Developer page</li> 
        <li>Going to the Applications page and create a New Application</li>
        <li>On your new Discord Bot's page, in the Bot subsection, click Reset Token and copy that password</li>
        <li>In the BotStartUp.java file delete lines 18, 19 and 20</li>
        <li>Instead of botToken, use your token that you just copied (make sure to add ""!)</li>
        <li>Tada! You can now run your own RPG Game on your server! Don't forget to invite your bot to the server though</li>
    </ul>
